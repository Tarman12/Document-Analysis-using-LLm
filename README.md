# Document-Analysis-using-LLm
# Document Analysis Using LLM and Semantic Scholar
# Overview
In the digital age, the volume of academic literature has exponentially increased, making it challenging for researchers to keep up with the latest advancements and discoveries in their fields. Traditional methods of literature review and data extraction are time-consuming and inefficient, often resulting in missed critical insights. To address these challenges, this project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Semantic Scholar for comprehensive document analysis.

# Features
Efficient Literature Review: Automates the tedious tasks of reading, summarizing, and extracting information from academic papers.
Real-Time Access: Provides real-time access to the latest research papers and updates from Semantic Scholar.
Enhanced Search Capabilities: Utilizes advanced semantic search algorithms to deliver more relevant and precise search results.
Contextual Understanding: Uses LLMs to understand the context and nuances in the text, enabling coherent and contextually relevant responses.
Scalability: Handles large volumes of academic literature efficiently, making it suitable for extensive research projects.
# Technologies Used
Large Language Models (LLMs): Utilized for natural language understanding and generation.
Semantic Scholar API: Provides access to a vast database of academic papers and metadata.
ChromaDB: A vector database optimized for storing and retrieving vector embeddings.
Python: The primary programming language used for development.
Streamlit: For developing the interactive user interface.
